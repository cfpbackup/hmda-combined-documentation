On October 15, 2015, the Bureau issued a final rule ([2015 HMDA Final Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/28/2015-26607/home-mortgage-disclosure-regulation-c)) amending Regulation C. In August 2017, the Bureau issued a final rule amending the 2015 HMDA Rule primarily to make technical corrections and clarify amendments ([2017 HMDA Final Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/13/2017-18284/home-mortgage-disclosure-regulation-c)). In August 2018, the Bureau issued an interpretive and procedural rule ([2018 HMDA Rule](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/bcfp_hmda_interpretive-procedural-rule_2018-08.pdf)) to implement and clarify the amendments to HMDA made by section 104(a) of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Act). Beginning with data collected in 2018, HMDA filers should report the data points described in the 2015 HMDA Final Rule and the 2017 HMDA Final Rule, as modified by the 2018 HMDA Rule for insured depository institutions and insured credit unions reporting transactions covered by a partial exemption.
